### Week 1

#### Lecture 1

##### Topics
* Welcome
* Introduction 
* What is parallel programming?
  - Motivation
  - Difficulties

##### Learning Objectives
* Understand why the shift towards parallel technologies occured
* The challenges this shift introduces to programmers
* High-level understanding of how to evolve a sequential algorithm/solution into a parallel one. 

##### Homework: Assignment 0 - Due before following lecture
1.  Introduce yourself, including your area of research and parallel programming experience.
2.	Why do you think running code in parallel will help overall performance. Will splitting up execution between 8 processing units get an 8x speed-up over a single processing unit? Why or why not?
3.	Do you foresee any problems involved with splitting execution up between multiple processing units, from a scalability and performance perspective?

#### Lecture 2

##### Topics
* Hardware
  * CPU, Memory, GPU  
    ~ Multithreading
  * CPU Memory Hierarchy    
    ~ Caches  
    ~ Locality

##### Learning Objectives
* Understand multi-threading with respect to CPUs.
* General high-level idea of how caching works. 

##### Homework: Assignment 1 – Due at the end of following week
1.  In C or C++, what information can you infer about the size of the system’s caches. Use any timer’s you deem necessary
2.	Outline the approach used in your code? How confident are you in your answers? Was there any noise in your results? If so, explain why you think this might occur
