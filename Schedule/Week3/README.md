### Week 3

#### Lecture 5/6/7

##### Topics
* Welcome
* Introduction 
* What is parallel programming?
  - Motivation
  - Difficulties

##### Learning Objectives
* Understand why the shift towards parallel technologies occured
* The challenges this shift introduces to programmers
* High-level understanding of how to evolve a sequential algorithm/solution into a parallel one. 

##### Homework: Assignment 0 - Due before following lecture
1.  Introduce yourself, including your area of research and parallel programming experience.
2.	Why do you think running code in parallel will help overall performance. Will splitting up execution between 8 processing units get an 8x speed-up over a single processing unit? Why or why not?
3.	Do you foresee any problems involved with splitting execution up between multiple processing units, from a scalability and performance perspective?
