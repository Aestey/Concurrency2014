### Week 3

#### Lecture 5/6/7

##### Topics
* Optimization strategies
  * Higher-level glance
  * Algorithms
  * Where is the bottleneck?
* Optimization in OpenCL
  * Preprocessing
  * Memory Coalescing
  * Local Reductions
* Guest lecture - term project idea (either Herzberg, Marc, Rick, etc)
  
##### Learning Objectives
* Understand the many factors involved with the optimization of a parallel solution
* Exploration of different optimization strategies
* Introduction on strategies to detect most threatening bottleneck(s).

##### Homework: Assignment 3 - Discussion about results in Lecture 10
1. Implement the map-reduce function with 2 solutions, one serial, and one in OpenCL
2. Compare the OpenCL performance with a serial version
3. Implement one of the optimization strategies discussed in lecture, and compare this with previous versions
4. Discussion: Show and explain your results. Are they what you expected? Can you explain the performance differences between your solutions? Outline a strategy for further optimization.
