### Week 4

#### Lecture 8

##### Topics
* Optimization strategies

##### Learning Objectives
* Understand the many factors involved with the optimization of a parallel solution
* Exploration of different optimization strategies
* Introduction on strategies to detect most threatening bottleneck(s).

#### Lecture 9
* Guest lecture - term project idea (either Herzberg, Marc, Rick, etc)

#### Lecture 10
* Presentation of Assignment 3 results, class discussion
  
##### Homework: Assignment 4 - Discussion about results in Lecture 13
1. Implement the map-reduce function with 2 solutions, one serial, and one in OpenCL
2. Compare the OpenCL performance with a serial version
3. Implement one of the optimization strategies discussed in lecture, and compare this with previous versions
4. Discussion: Show and explain your results. Are they what you expected? Can you explain the performance differences between your solutions? Outline a strategy for further optimization.
