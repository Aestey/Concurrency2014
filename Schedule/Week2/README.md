### Week 2

##### Topics
* Software
  * Kernels
  * OpenCL
    ~ Memory: global, local, shared  
  * GPU Memory Hierarchy
  	~ Warps
 	~ Synchronization
* Hands on OpenCL example (**Guest lecture from Belaid at Compute Canada?**)
  * How to connect, upload, and execute on Westgrid systems
  * Explanation and walkthrough of OpenCL code

##### Learning Objectives
* Understand what a kernel is, and how to write a simple one
* Explore a program containing OpenCL
* High-level understanding of how to evolve a sequential algorithm/solution into a parallel one. 

##### Homework: Assignment 2 - Due at the end of following week
1.  Introduce yourself, including your area of research and parallel programming experience.
2.	Why do you think running code in parallel will help overall performance. Will splitting up execution between 8 processing units get an 8x speed-up over a single processing unit? Why or why not?
3.	Do you foresee any problems involved with splitting execution up between multiple processing units, from a scalability and performance perspective?
