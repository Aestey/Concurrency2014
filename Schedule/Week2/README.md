### Week 2

##### Topics
* Software
  * Kernels
  * OpenCL  
    ~ Memory: global, local, shared  
  * GPU Memory Hierarchy  
  	~ Warps  
 	~ Synchronization
* Hands on OpenCL example ( **tentative: guest lecture by Belaid from Compute Canada?** )
  * How to connect, upload, and run a program on the Westgrid systems
  * Explanation and walkthrough of OpenCL code

##### Learning Objectives
* Understand what a kernel is, and how to write a simple one
* Explore a program containing OpenCL

##### Homework: Assignment 2 - Due at the end of following week
1. Connect and upload the example files to one of the Westgrid systems
2.	Obtain device information 
3.	Explore the add function. Are there any ways 

**Note:** If Belaid cannot attend, the hands-on OpenCL lecture will be very similar to the Introduction to OpenCL found [here] (http://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/heterogeneous-computing/amd-accelerated-parallel-processing-app-sdk/introductory-tutorial-to-opencl/), 
which covers roughly the same material as Belaid's lecture. He also showed how to use the Westgrid systems, and add a simple vector addition function to the code.
