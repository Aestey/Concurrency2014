===============

Will format this readme soon.  

Teaming up with a student from Excercise Science, Physical and Health Education (EPHE). Paul Lalonde will introduce the project in a guest lecture. He is teaching a project-based course on mechanics where they will be using a ton of sensors to monitor participants on a treadmill and stationary bike, and would like to collect and process data in real-time to for injury detection/prevention. He is working with LabView, [which now has support for OpenCL] (http://sine.ni.com/nips/cds/view/p/lang/en/nid/211893).
