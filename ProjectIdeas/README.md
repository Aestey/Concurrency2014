ProjectIdeas
===============

Will format this readme soon.  

##### Implementation/Improvement of an idea from the ReadlingList
If there is a paper in the reading list that really interests a student, they will be 
encouraged to explore the problem further, and see if they can implement and improve the 
idea discuess in the paper. 

##### OpenCL with Labview
Teaming up with a student from Excercise Science, Physical and Health Education (EPHE). 
Marc Klimstra will introduce the project in a guest lecture. 
Dr. Klimstra is teaching BioMechanics in the Spring, a project-based course where students will be using a system
built with many sensors to monitor participants on a treadmill and stationary bike, the objective is to 
collect and process data in real-time to for injury detection/prevention. He is working 
with LabView, [which now has support for OpenCL] (http://sine.ni.com/nips/cds/view/p/lang/en/nid/211893). 
His students will have taken a pre-requisite where they have programmed in Labview, but have
are not likely to have any traditional programming or OpenCL experience.
 

##### TMT Project with the Herzberg Institute of Technology
This project will also be introduced and motivated in a guest lecture. 
The objective is to optimize a conjugate gradient algorithm working with a considerably large input matrix 
(dimensions are 52k x 52k).
